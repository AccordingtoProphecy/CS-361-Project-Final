# Welcome to my project DUEL!

## If you wish to play it, here are a few steps you must take first:

### Make sure Python3 is installed on your device and added to your PATH
- You can get it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Make sure Python Requests is installed
- You can use ```pip install requests``` once Python is installed

### Clone the repo onto your device
- Use ```git clone https://github.com/AccordingtoProphecy/CS-361-Project-Final.git``` whereever you decide to play from

### Navigate to the src directory of the project
- Use ```python main.py``` in the directory to start the game!

Obviously it's pretty rudimentary, but I hope to eventually turn this into a full game at some point. In the meantime, try it, have some fun, and, most importantly, DUEL!
